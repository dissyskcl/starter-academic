  <i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> <strong>Note:</strong> Due to Covid19, students will be given the opportunity to take this programme entirely remotely in 2020/21, if they wish to do so. All the course material will be made available online and there will be regular live interactions with lecturers and tutors.

## Course pre-requisites
The course has as entry requirement first or upper second class in **Mathematics** or **Physics**. Outstanding candidates from other degrees in quantitative subjects may be considered, provided they have had sufficient exposure to mathematical and physical sciences. Please check whether your background is suitable for this programme, by answering our [admission questionnaire](http://www.nms.kcl.ac.uk/CSMMSC/CSM_Questionnaire-2021.pdf).

If you have a few gaps in your background or need a refresher, we offer a non-examinable support course, [Foundations for CSM](https://keats.kcl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=66816), which runs for 6 weeks in Semester I. You are encouraged to start reading the [Lecture notes](http://www.nms.kcl.ac.uk/CSMMSC/Course_Book.pdf) prior to the start of the course.

# General Information
## Course Structure
The course is **one year** long if attended full-time, or two years long if attended Part-time, from September to September. It consists of **8 modules** (15 credits each) plus a *Summer research project* (60 credits, running from June to September) for a total of 180 credits.
You can also take up to two modules from other **University of London institutions**, such as UCL and QMUL, subject to the approval of the programme director. See the [Induction slides](http://www.nms.kcl.ac.uk/CSMMSC/1920induction.pdf) and the [Induction handouts](http://www.nms.kcl.ac.uk/CSMMSC/Modules1920.pdf) for more information.

## Expected workload
The workload is at least **10 hours per module per week**, typically distributed as follows:
<ul>
<li>3 hours lecture (some modules may have 2 hours);</li>
<li>1 hour tutorial;</li>
<li>6 hours self-study and coursework (depending on your background, some modules may require more hours).</li>
</ul>

## Assessment
Assessments are mostly two-hour written exams in May (very few modules have January exams). They consits in essays, oral presentations and dissertations. Practicals, class tests and assessed courseworks are possible, depending on the modules selected. Resits opportunities (for modules failed in May) are normally offered in August
