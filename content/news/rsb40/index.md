The far-reaching implications of the theory of spin glasses were highlighted further by the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physics, of which half was awarded to Giorgio Parisi for "the discovery of the interplay of disorder and fluctuations in physical systems from atomic to planetary scales." Since the first observation in the 1960s, the theory of spin glasses has unexpectedly found applications in a wide array of scientific problems. This ranges from amorphous solids to movements of birds as they fly in a flock.

In [**Spin Glass Theory and Far Beyond**](https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/13341#t=aboutBook), more than 30 contributions are compiled from more than 100 leading
researchers who contributed to these applications over the last few decades. This volume provides a detailed introduction and review of spin glass research. While the fundamentals are expounded, cutting-edge and state-ofthe-art applications are also featured in this encyclopedic overview for enthusiastic readers in the 21st century

The volume is edited by Patrick Charbonneau, Enzo Marinari, Marc Mézard, Giorgio Parisi, Federico Ricci-Tersenghi, Gabriele Sicuro, and Francesco Zamponi.
