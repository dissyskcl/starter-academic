The Disordered Systems group organised a [two-day event](https://disorderdayskcl.weebly.com/) on the physics of disorder in both the classical and quantum setting, hosting a selection of international leading experts in the field. The first day of the event has been dedicated to our dear colleague **Reimer Kühn**, who retired in 2023. The Workshop has been an opportunity to thank Reimer for his invaluable contributions to the field and to the life of our research group.

You can find the program of the event, with some material, below.
