# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: We are organising a two-days event on the physics of disorder in both the classical and quantum setting, hosting a selection of international leading experts in the field. The first day of the event will be dedicated to our dear colleague **Reimer KÃ¼hn**, who is retiring at the end of the current academic year. The Workshop will be an opportunity to thank Reimer for his invaluable contributions to the field and to the life of our research group.
