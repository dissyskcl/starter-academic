The research activities of the group concentrate on the analysis and development of mathematical theories and models with which to describe the statics and dynamics of disordered (or "complex") systems in physics, biology, financial markets, and computer science. Such systems are characterized by microscopic (usually stochastic) dynamic elements with mutual interactions without global regularity but with a significant degree of built-in competition and incompatibility, resulting in the existence of many locally stable states for the system as a whole and a highly non-ergodic "glassy" type of dynamics.
