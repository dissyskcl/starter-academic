A collaboration between group members Kuehn and Perez Castillo and international collaborators also led to a breakthrough in the spectral problem for sparse symmetric random matrices, allowing to efficiently compute spectral densities of such systems in the limit of large matrix size to any desired accuracy -- more than 20 years after a solution to this problem was first attempted.
