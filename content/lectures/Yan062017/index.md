<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
How many equilibria will a large complex system, modeled by N randomly coupled autonomous nonlinear differential equations typically have? How many of those equilibria are stable, that is are local attractors of the nearby trajectories? These questions arise in many applications and can be partly answered by employing the methods of Random Matrix Theory.
