location: Clay Mathematics Institute

summary: "**Yan Fyodorov** discusses some results, both old and more recent, on 'non-orthogonality overlap matrix' between left and right eigenvectors of non-normal random matrices. Motivations range from understanding eigenvalue dynamics under matrix perturbations to relevance for random matrix models describing chaotic wave scattering.  "
