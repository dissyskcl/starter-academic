title: Hydrodynamics of quantum and classical integrable systems, correlations and fluctuations
external_link: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRN080X85Ec"
event: Emergent hydrodynamics in low dimensional quantum systems
event_url: https://iip.ufrn.br/eventsdetail.php?inf=%3D%3DQTUFFM

location: IIP

summary: "Hydrodynamics proposes that the effective dynamical degrees of freedom of a many-body system can be reduced, at large scales, to those given by the available local conservation laws. After reviewing some of the main ingredients of the general theory of hydrodynamics for multiple conservation laws, **Benjamin Doyon** explains how these ideas can be adapted to the context of integrable systems."
