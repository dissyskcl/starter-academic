Pierpaolo Vivo studied Physics at the Università degli Studi di Parma (Italy), where he also graduated in Theoretical Physics cum laude in 2005 under the supervision of Enrico Onofri with the thesis "Modifications of gravity for low accelerations". He then moved to Brunel University (West London), where he obtained his PhD in 2008 under the supervision of Gernot Akemann with the thesis "From Wishart to Jacobi ensembles: Statistical properties and applications". He was then awarded a three-year Postdoctoral Fellowship at Abdus Salam ICTP - Trieste (Italy), where he worked in the Condensed Matter and Statistical Physics group led by Vladimir Kravtsov. There he collaborated mainly with Antonello Scardicchio and Matteo Marsili on applications of Random Matrix Theory and Statistical Mechanics to the stability of financial markets. During the period 2011-2014 he worked as a research scientist at the Laboratoire de Physique Théorique et Modèles Statistiques (LPTMS) in Orsay, (France). He has been a permanent member of the Disordered Systems group at King's College London since September 2014.
