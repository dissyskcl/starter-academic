abstract: Although the spectral properties of random graphs have been a long-standing
  focus of network theory, the properties of right eigenvectors of directed graphs
  have so far eluded an exact analytic treatment. We present a general theory for
  the statistics of the right eigenvector components in directed random graphs with
  a prescribed degree distribution and with randomly weighted links. We obtain exact
  analytic expressions for the inverse participation ratio and show that right eigenvectors
  of directed random graphs with a small average degree are localized. Remarkably,
  if the fourth moment of the degree distribution is finite, then the critical mean
  degree of the localization transition is independent of the degree fluctuations,
  which is different from localization in undirected graphs that is governed by degree
  fluctuations. We also show that in the high connectivity limit the distribution
  of the right eigenvector components is solely determined by the degree distribution.
  For delocalized eigenvectors, we recover in this limit the universal results from
  standard random matrix theory that are independent of the degree distribution, while
  for localized eigenvectors the eigenvector distribution depends on the degree distribution.
