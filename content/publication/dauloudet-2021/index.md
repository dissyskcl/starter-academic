abstract: 'Abstract: Translation is one of the main steps in the synthesis of proteins.
  It consists of ribosomes that translate sequences of nucleotides encoded on mRNA
  into polypeptide sequences of amino acids. Ribosomes bound to mRNA move unidirectionally,
  while unbound ribosomes diffuse in the cytoplasm. It has been hypothesized that
  finite diffusion of ribosomes plays an important role in ribosome recycling and
  that mRNA circularization enhances the efficiency of translation, see e.g. Lodish
  et al. (Molecular cell biology, 8th edn, W.H. Freeman and Company, San Francisco,
  2016). In order to estimate the effect of cytoplasmic diffusion on the rate of translation,
  we consider a totally asymmetric simple exclusion process coupled to a finite diffusive
  reservoir, which we call the ribosome transport model with diffusion. In this model,
  we derive an analytical expression for the rate of protein synthesis as a function
  of the diffusion constant of ribosomes, which is corroborated with results from
  continuous-time Monte Carlo simulations. Using a wide range of biological relevant
  parameters, we conclude that diffusion is not a rate limiting factor in translation
  initiation because diffusion is fast enough in biological cells. Graphic abstract:
