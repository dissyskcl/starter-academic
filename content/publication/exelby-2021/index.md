abstract: During development, gene regulatory networks allocate cell fates by partitioning
  tissues into spatially organised domains of gene expression. How the sharp boundaries
  that delineate these gene expression patterns arise, despite the stochasticity associated
  with gene regulation, is poorly understood. We show, in the vertebrate neural tube,
  using perturbations of coding and regulatory regions, that the structure of the
  regulatory net- work contributes to boundary precision. This is achieved, not by
  reducing noise in individual genes, but by the configuration of the network modulating
  the ability of stochastic fluctuations to initiate gene expression changes. We use
  a computational screen to identify network properties that influence boundary precision,
  revealing two dynamical mechanisms by which small gene circuits attenuate the effect
  of noise in order to increase patterning precision. These results highlight design
  principles of gene regulatory networks that produce precise patterns of gene expression.
