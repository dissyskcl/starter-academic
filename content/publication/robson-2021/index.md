abstract: We introduce a mean-field framework for the study of systems of interacting
  particles sharing a conserved quantity. The work generalises and unites the existing
  fields of asset-exchange models, often applied to socio-economic systems, and aggregation-fragmentation
  models, typically used in modelling the dynamics of clusters. An initial model includes
  only two-body collisions, which is then extended to include many-body collisions
  and spontaneous fragmentation. We derive self-consistency equations for the steady-state
  distribution, which can be solved using a population dynamics algorithm, as well
  as a full solution for the time evolution of the moments, corroborated with numerical
  simulations. The generality of the model makes it applicable to many problems and
  allows for the study of systems exhibiting more complex interactions that those
  typically considered. The work is relevant to the modelling of barchan dune fields
  in which interactions between the bedforms and spontaneous fragmentation due to
  changes in the wind are thought to lead to size-selection. Our work could also be
  applied in finding wealth distributions when agents can both combine assets as well
  as split into multiple subsidiaries.
