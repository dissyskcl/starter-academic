abstract: We explore glassy dynamics of dense assemblies of soft particles that are
  self-propelled by active forces. These forces have a fixed amplitude and a propulsion
  direction that varies on a timescale τp, the persistence timescale. Numerical simulations
  of such active glasses are computationally challenging when the dynamics is governed
  by large persistence times. We describe in detail a recently proposed scheme that
  allows one to study directly the dynamics in the large persistence time limit, on
  timescales around and well above the persistence time. We discuss the idea behind
  the proposed scheme, which we call “activity-driven dynamics”, as well as its numerical
  implementation. We establish that our prescription faithfully reproduces all dynamical
  quantities in the appropriate limit τp → ∞. We deploy the approach to explore in
  detail the statistics of Eshelby-like plastic events in the steady state dynamics
  of a dense and intermittent active glass.
