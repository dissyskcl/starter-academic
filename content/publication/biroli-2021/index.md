abstract: "In this paper we study the out-of-equilibrium phase diagram of the quantum\
  \ version of Derrida's random energy model, which is the simplest model of mean-field\
  \ spin glasses. We interpret its corresponding quantum dynamics in Fock space as\
  \ a one-particle problem in very high dimension to which we apply different theoretical\
  \ methods tailored for high-dimensional lattices: the forward-scattering approximation,\
  \ a mapping to the Rosenzweig-Porter model, and the cavity method. Our results indicate\
  \ the existence of two transition lines and three distinct dynamical phases: a completely\
  \ many-body localized phase at low energy, a fully ergodic phase at high energy,\
  \ and a multifractal \\\"bad metal\\\"phase at intermediate energy. In the latter,\
  \ eigenfunctions occupy a diverging volume yet an exponentially vanishing fraction\
  \ of the total Hilbert space. We discuss the limitations of our approximations and\
  \ the relationship with previous studies."
