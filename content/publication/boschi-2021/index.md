abstract: In modern society people are being exposed to numerous information, with
  some of them being frequently repeated or more disruptive than others. In this paper
  we use a model of opinion dynamics to study how this news impact the society. In
  particular, our study aims to explain how the exposure of the society to certain
  events deeply change peopletextquoterights perception of the present and future.
  The evolution of opinions which we consider is influenced both by external information
  and the pressure of the society. The latter includes imitation, differentiation,
  homophily and its opposite, xenophobia. The combination of these ingredients gives
  rise to a collective memory effect, which is triggered by external information.
  In this paper we focus our attention on how this memory arises when the order of
  appearance of external news is random. We will show which characteristics a piece
  of news needs to have in order to be embedded in the societytextquoterights memory.
  We will also provide an analytical way to measure how many information a society
  can remember when an extensive number of news items is presented. Finally we will
  show that, when a certain piece of news is present in the societytextquoterights
  history, even a distorted version of it is sufficient to trigger the memory of the
  originally stored information.
