abstract: 'We focus on the energy landscape of a simple mean-field model of glasses
  and analyze activated barrier-crossing by combining the Kac-Rice method for high-dimensional
  Gaussian landscapes with dynamical field theory. In particular, we consider Langevin
  dynamics at low temperature in the energy landscape of the pure spherical p-spin
  model. We select as initial condition for the dynamics one of the many unstable
  index-1 saddles in the vicinity of a reference local minimum. We show that the associated
  dynamical mean-field equations admit two solutions: one corresponds to falling back
  to the original reference minimum, and the other to reaching a new minimum past
  the barrier. By varying the saddle we scan and characterize the properties of such
  minima reachable by activated barrier-crossing. Finally, using time-reversal transformations,
  we construct the two-point function dynamical instanton of the corresponding activated
  process.'
